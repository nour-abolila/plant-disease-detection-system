# Plant Disease Detection System

## 🌱 Project Overview
This project is a **Graduation Project** for the Faculty of Computer Science.  
The goal is to build a **Plant Disease Detection System** that can:

- Detect plant diseases from images of leaves or fruits.  
- Identify the type of disease or healthy status.  
- Suggest possible treatments.  

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Backend**  
2. **AI Model**  
3. **Mobile / Web UI**
